# This repository contains my *Portfolio Selection Assignment* for the Quantitative Investing course at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

The assignment is designed as a **weekly extension project**:

* **Part I (Week 1):** Construction of a baseline portfolio using a simple momentum strategy on S&P 500 stocks, allocating $100,000 across positive return stocks and a 1% risk-free asset.
* **Part II (Weeks 2â€“6):** Iterative updates of the portfolio based on course topics. For example, in Week 2 I moved to a mean-variance optimized tangency portfolio (long-only), with later weeks planned to introduce further refinements.

Each week builds on the previous one, demonstrating the progression from a naive benchmark to increasingly sophisticated portfolio construction methods. The repository documents both the methodology and the reasoning behind each step.
